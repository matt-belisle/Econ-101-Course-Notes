# Monopoly

## Monopoly and How it Arisies

A *monopoly* is a market with a single firm that produces a good or service with no close substitutes and is protected by a barrier that prevents other firms from entering the market.

### How Monopoly Arises

A monopoly arises for two reasons:
1. No Close Substitutes
	*  If a good has a close substitute, even though only one firm produces it, the firm still effectively faces competition from the producers of the substitute
	* A monopoly sells a good with **NO** close substitutes.
2.  Barrier to Entry
	A constraint that protects a firm from potential competitors is called a *barrier to entry* there are three types of barriers
	1. Natural
		* A natural barrier to entry creates a *natural monopoly*: a market in which economies of scale enable one firm to supply the entire market at the lowest possible cost ( generally LRAC is always decreasing ) 
		* For example firms that deliver gas, water, and electricity
	2. Ownership
		* An ownership barrier to entry occurs if one firm owns a significant portion of a key resource. 
		*  For example De Beers in the late 1900s owned 90% of the worlds supply of diamonds
	3. Legal
		* A legal barrier to entry creates a *legal monopoly*: a market in which competition and entry are restricted by the granting of a public franchise, government license, or copyright
		* A *public franchise* is an exclusive right granted by a firm to supply a good or service (Canada Post for residential mail)
		* A *government license* controls entry into particular occupatoins, proffesions, and indutries (Doctors, Engineers, etc), licensing does not create a monpoly, but it does restrict competition
		* A *patent* is an exclusive right granted to the inventer of a service or product
			* Lasts for 20 years
			* Encourage innovation and invention of new products, and encourage inventors to publicize discoveries and offer use under licenses
		* A *copyright* is an exclusive right granted to the author or composer of a literary, musical, dramatic, or artistic work

### Monopoly Price Setting Strategies

A monopoly sets its own price, in doing so it faves a market constraint: to sell a larger quantity, the monopoly must set a lower price.  There are two situations that create two different pricing strategies:

1. Single Price
	* A *single-price monopoly* is a firm that must sell each unit of its output for the same price to all its customers. 
	* If this firm tries to sell at a low price to some and higher to others, only the low price customers would buy, and others would buy from the low price customers (resale). 
2. Price Discrimination
	* When a firm uses *price-discirimination* it sells different units of a good or service for different prices. (Microsoft with Office/Windows)
	* When a firm price discriminates it looks as though it is doing its customers a favour, in fact it is charging the highest possible price for each unit sold and making the largest possible profit

## A Single-Price Monopoly's Output and Price Decision

To understand how a single-price monpoly makes its output and price decision, we must first study the link between price and marginal revenue

### Price and Marginal Revenue

Because in a monopoly there is only one firm, the market demand curve is just the demand curve. 

Recall Total Revenue TR =P*Q
Marginal Revenue MR is change in TR resulting in a one-unit increase in quantity sold
The MR curve will always lie below the demand curve? why -> because price must be lowered to sell one more unit, two opposing forces affect total revenue. The lower price results in revenue lost on the original units sold, and a revenue gin on the additional quantity sold. MR will equal revenue gained from new unit - revenue lost from old units, revenue gained from new unit equals price so the MR is less than price.

 ### Marginal Revenue and Elasticity
A single price monopoly's marginal revenue is related to the *elasticity of demand* for its good.  The demand for a good can be elastic, inelatic, or unit elastic. Demand is elastic is a 1% fall in price brings a greater than 1% increase in quantity demanded, demand is inelastic if a 1% fall in price brings <1% increase in quantity demanded, demand is unit elastic if a 1% fall in price brings exactly a 1% increase in quantity demanded.

The highest total revenue a firm can have will be when its elasticity is unit elastic (elasticity = 1)

#### In Monopoly, Demand is Always Elastic 
The relationship between MR and elasticity implies that a profit maximizing monpoly never produces an output in the inelastic range of the market demand curve. If it did so, it could charge a higher price, produce a smaller quantity, and increase its profit. 

### Price and Output Decision

A monopoly sets its price and output at the levels that maximize economic profit. To determine that price and output level we need to analyze the bahaviour of both cost and revenue as output varies. A monopoly faces the same types of technology and cost restraints as a competitive firm, so its costs (TC,AC,MC) behave the same as a firm in perfect competition, and their revenues (TR, Price, MR) behave in the way we described above

 #### Maximizing Economic Profit
  
  TC and TR both rise as output increases, but TC rises faster than TR, and economic profit = TR - TC, therefore increases, peaks, and then decreases. 

#### Marginal Revenue Equals Marginal Cost

* MR > MC, profit increases if output increses
*  MR < MC Profit increases if output decreases
*  MR = MC Profit maximized

#### Maximum Price the Market will Bear

Unlike a firm in perfect competition a monopoly influences the price of what it sells

But a monopoly does not set the price at the maximum *possible* price, as the firm would only sell one unit, and the profit is most likely less than what it would be at the profit maximizing price.

Rather, the monopoly produces the profit-maximizing quantity and sells that quantity for the highest price it can get. 

All firms maximize profit by producing at the point MR = MC, and for a competitive firm price = MR, but in a monopoly price exceeds MR, so price also exceeds marginal cost.

If firms in a perfectly competitive market make a positive economic profit, other firms enter, this does not happen in a monopoly because of barriers to entry, so a monopoly can make a positive economic profit and may do so indefinitely.

## Single Price Monopoly and Competition Compared

Imagine a market is made up of many small firms operating in perfect competition. What would happen the the market if a single firm buys all of the small firms and asserts a monopoly?

We will analyze the effects of a monopoly on the price and quantity produced.

### Comparing Price and Output

Recall: 

* Perfect Competition
	* Equilibrium occurs occurs where the supply curve and the demand curve intersect
	* Each firm takes the market price, and maximizes irs profit by producing the output at which its own marginal cost equals the market price.
	* Since each firm is a small part of the total industry there is no incentive to manipulate the price by varying its output
* Monopoly
	* Monopoly maximizes profit by producing the quantity at which MR = MC
	* To create the marginal cost curve for the new monopoly, first recall that in perfect competition the market supply curve is the sum of the supply curves of the firms in the industry, also recall each firms supply curve is its MC curve. So when the market is taken over by a single firm, the competitive market's supply curve becomes the monopoly's marginal cost curve. 
	* The price a monopoly charges is higher than it is in a non-monopoly market
	* The quantity a monopoly supplies is less than it is in a non-monopoly market


### Efficiency Comparison

* Perfect Competition
	* At the competitive equlibrium, marginal social benefit exceeds marginal social cost
	* Total surplus maximized
	* Firms produce at the lowest possible long-run average cost
	* Resource use is efficient
* Monopoly
	* A monopoly produces Quantity < what is produced in perfect competition
	* A monopoly sells at a Price > price in perfect competition
	* The smaller Q and higher P drive a wedge between marginal social benefit and marginal social cost creating a deadweight loss
		* The Consumer surplus shrinks for two reasons
			1.  Consumers lose by paying more for the good, this goes to the producer surplus
			2. Consumers lose by getting less of the good, this is the deadweight lose
		* The Producer Surplus grows because of the loss to consumers by raising the price
		* The producer surplus shrinks a bit because it produces a smaller output, this is part of the deadweight loss
	* The magnitude of deadweight loss is a measure of the inefficiency of the monopoly

A monopoly produces a smaller output than perfect competition and faces no competition, so it does not produce at the lowest possible long-run average cost. As a result, monopoly damages the consumer interest in three ways.

1.  A monopoly produces less
2.  Increases the cost of production
3. Raises the price by more than the increases cost of production

A monopoly is *inefficient*

### Redistribution of Surpluses

A monopoly redistributes the surpluses. Some of the lost consumer surplus goes to the monopoly. This portion lost is not a loss to society, it is a redistribution from consumers to the monopoly producer

### Rent Seeking

A monopoly creates a deadweight loss and is inefficient, but the social cost of a monopoly can exceed the deadweight loss because of an activity called *rent seeking*. Any surplus -- consumer surplus, producer surplus, or economic profit -- is called *Economic Rent*. The pursuit of wealth by capturing economic rent is called *rent seeking*. Therefore since the monopoly makes its economic profit by diverting consumer suplus to its producer surplus, the pursuit of economic profit by a monopoly is rent seeking. It is the attempt to capture consumer surplus.

Rent seekers pursue their goals in two ways:
1. Buy a monopoly
	* To rent seek by buying a monopoly, a person searches for a monopoly that is for sale at a lower price than the monopoly's economic profit
	* People rationally devote time and effort to seeking out profitable monpoly businesses to buy. In the process the use up scarce resources that could have otherwise been used to produce goods and services. The value of this lost production is part of the social cost of monopoly
	* The amount paid for a monopoly is *not* a social cost because the payment transfers an existing producer surplus from the buyer to the seller. 
2. Create a monoply
	* Rent seeking by creating a monopoly is mainly a political activity. 
	* It takes the form of lobbying and trying to influence the political process. 
	* This type of rent seeking is a costly activity that uses up scarce resources
		* Together firms spend billions of dollars lobbying MPs, MPPs, and bureaucrats in the pursuit of licenses and laws that create barriers to entry and establish a monopoly

### Rent-Seeking Equilibrium

Barriers to entry create monopoly, but there is no barrier to entry into rent seeking. Rent seeking is like perfect competition, if an economic profit is available a new rent seeker will try to get some of it. Competition among rent seekers pushes up the price that must be paid for a monopoly, to the point at which the rent seeker makes zero economic profit by operating the monopoly.

## Price Discrimination

*Price Discrimination* selling a good or service at a number of different prices

Not all *price differences* are *price discriminations*: they reflect differences in production costs, for example real-time meters for electricity enable power utilities to charge a different price at peak load times than during the night *but* it costs more for the the firm to produce power at peak load times, so this price difference reflects differences in production costs and is *not* price discrimination

To be able to price discriminat a producer must sell a product that cannot be resold; and it must be possible to identify and seperate different buyer types

### Two wars of Price Discriminating

Firms price discriminate in two ways:

1. Among groups of buyers
	* People differ in ther value they place ona  good, their marginal benefit and willingness to pay. Some of these differences are correlated with features such as age, employment status, and other easily distinguished characteristics. When such a correlation is present firms can profit by discrimnating among the buyers.
	
2. Among units of a good 
	* Everyone experiences diminishing marginal benefit, so if all the goods are sold for a single price, buyers end up with surplus equal to the value from each unit minus the price they paid for it
	* A firm that discriminates by charging a buyer one prices for a single item and less for a second or third item can capture some of the consumer surplus, BOGO at a lower price is an example of this. 

### Increasing Profit and Producer Surplus

By getting buyers to pay a price as close as possible to their maximum willingness to pay, a monopoly captures the consumer surplus and converts it into producer surplus. More producer surplus = more economic profit

To see why consider the following

Economic Profit = TR - TC

Producer surplus is total revenuce minus the area under the marginal cost curve, which is equal to TVC

Producer Surplus = TR-TVC

The difference between EP and PS, is the same as the difference between TC and TVC but TC - TVC = TFC, so 

Economic Profit = Producer Surplus - TFC

Therefore the greater the Producer Surplus the greater the Economic Profit


#### Perfect Price Discrimination

Firms try to capture an even larger part of consumer surplus by devising a host of special conditions, each one of which appeals to a tiny segment of the market but at the same time excludes others from taking advantage of a lower price. The more consumer surplus a firm is able to capture, the closer it gets to *perfect price discrimination*, which occurs if a firm can sell each unit of output for the highest possible price someone is willing to pay for it. In this case there is no consumer surplus and it is all captured by producer surplus

In this case the market demand curve becomes the marginal revenue curve, the reason is that when the monopoly cuts the price to sell a larger quantity it sell only the marginal unit at the lower price. All the other units continue to be sold at the highest price someone is willing to pay for it. So for perfect discrimniation, MR equals price and the market demand curve becomes the monopolys marginal revenue curve. 

### Efficiency and Rent Seeking With Price Discrimination
The more perfectly the monopoly can price discriminate, the closer its output is to the competitive output and the more efficient is the outcome

The distribution of total surplus in perfect price discimination is entirely producer surplus, and since the monopoly takes all of the surplus, rent seeking is profitable.

People use resources in pursuit of economic rent, and the bigger the rents, the more resources are used in pursuing them. With free entry into rent seeking, the long run equilibrium outcome is that rent seekers use up the entire producer surplus. 

 ## Monopoly Regulation

Natural monopoly presents a dilemma, with economies of scale, it produces at the lowest possible cost. But with market power, it has an incentive to raise the price above the competitive price and produce too little -- to operate in the self interest of the monopolist and not in the social interest

*Regulation* -- rules administered by a government agency to influence prices, quantities, wntry, and other aspects of economic activity in a firm or industry -- is a possible solution to this dilemma

*Deregulation* -- the process of removing regulation of prices, quantities, entry, and other aspects of economic activity in a firm or industry

Regulations is a possible solution to the dilemma caused by natural monopolies but not a guarantedd solution, there are two theories about how regulation actually works:
1. Social Interst Theory
	* Political and regulatory process relentlessly seeks out inefficiency and introduces regulation that eliminates deadweight loss and allocates resources efficiently
2. Capture Theory
	* Regulation serves the self iterest of the producer, who captures the regulator and maximizes economic profit. Regulation that benefits the producer but creates a deadweight loss gets adopted because the producer's gain is larger and visible while each individual consumers loss is small and invisible. No individual consumer has an incentive to oppose the regulation but the producer has a big incentive to lobby for it. 

### Efficient Regulation of a Natural Monopoly
  To efficiently regulate use the marginal cost pricing rule, this sets its price equal to the marginal cos. The quantity demanded at a price equal to the marginal cost is the efficient quantity -- the quantity at which marginal benefit = marginal cost.

This may cause the monopoly to go into economic loss is the ATC exceeds marginal cost at this output, so how would the monopoly stay in business? There are two possible ways of enabling the firm to cover its costs: price discrimination, and a two part price (also called two part tariff)

### Second Best Regulation of a Natural Monopoly

A natural monopoly cannot always be regulated to achieve an efficient outcome, there are two possible ways of enabling a regulated monopoly to avoid an economic loss

1. Average Cost Pricing
	* The average cost pricing rule sets price equal to average total cost, with this rule the firm produces the quantity at which the ATC cuts the demand curve. This results in the firm making zero economic profit -- breaking even
	* Since for a monopoly ATC exceeds marginal cost, the quantity produced is less thean the efficient quantity and deadweight arises

2. Governement Subsidy
	* A gobernment subsidy is a direct payment to the firm equal to its economic loss, to pay a subsidy a government must raise the tax revenue by taxing some other activity (taxes create deadweight loss)

Which is the better option?

The answer depends on the size of the two deadweight losses, the one that is smaller is the better solution. 

It is very difficult to discern the exact amounts of deadweight loss created by either so in general the average cost pricing rule is introduced. 

Implementing ACP is difficult because it is not possible to be sure what a firm's costs are, so regulators use one of two practical rules

1. Rate of Return Regulation
	* Under rate of return regulation a firm must justify its price by showing that its return on capital doesn't exceed a specified target rate. 
	* This type of regulation can end up serving the interest of the monopoly, as they can just spend money frivolously (private jets, hockey tickets, etc) to inflate their costs and reduce the rate of return 
	* Note; the rate of return is regulated, not the total return on capital, and the greater the amount of capital the greater the total return
2. Price Cap Regulation
	* A price cap regulation is a price ceiling
	* This type of regulation gives a firm an incentive to operate efficiently and keep costs under control. 
	* Replacing rate of return regulation
