# Monopolistic Competition

## What is Monopolistic Competition?

Most real world markets are competitive but not perfectly competitive, because firms in these markets have some power to set their prices, as monopolies do. We call this type of market *monopolistic competition*. 

Monopolistic Competition is a market structure in which

* A large number of firms compete
* Each firm produces a differentiated product
* Firms compete on product quality, price, and marketing
* Firms are free to enter and exit the industry


### A Large Number of Firms

The presence of a large numebr of firms has three implications

1. Small Market Share
	* Similar to perfect competition each firm produces a small part of total indutry output, consequently each firm has a limited ability to influence price of the product.
2. Ignore Other Firms
	* A firm in MC must be sensitive to the average market price, but it needs not concern itself with the individual firms.
3. Collusion Impossible
	* Firms in MC would like to be able to conspire to fix a higher price, but because there are a large number of firms coordination is difficult and collusion is not possible

### Product Differentiation

A firm practices product differentiation if it makes a product that is slightly different from the products of competing firms. A differentiated product is one that is a close substitute but not a perfect substitute. 

### Competing on Quality Price and Marketing

Product differentiation allows a firm to compete with other firms in three areas

1. Quality
	* Some firms sell higher quality products for more, and others sell lower quality products for less
2. Price
	* A firm in a MC faces downwards sloping demand curve, so, like a monopoly the firm can set both price and output, but there is a tradeoff between quality and price. 
3. Marketing
	* Marketing takes two main forms:
		* Advertising 
		* Packaging
	
### Entry and Exit
MC has no barriers to prevent new firms from entering the industy in the long run, consequently a firm in MC cannot make an Economic Profit in the long run. (Recall Perfect Competition)


## Price and Output in Monopolistic Competition

### The Firm's Short-Run Output and Price Decision

In the short run, a firm in Monopolistic Compeition makes its output and price decision just like a monopoly firm does. 
(MR = MC)
Similar to monopolies, the profit maximizing may be the loss minimizing if the demand for the differnetiated good is not high enough to produce an economic profit


### Long Run Zero Economic Profit

A firm who is incurring an economic loss will not incur it for long, as they will go out of business.

In the long run if firms are making an economic profit then new firms (or existing firms) will join the market and create items similar to an item that is making a firm profit, this will drive demand lower in the long run and firms will enter until there is zero economic profit in the long run

### Monopolistic Competition and Perfect Competition

There are two key differences between monopolistic competition and perfect competition:

1. Excess Capacity
	* A firm has excess capacity if it produces less than its efficient scale, which is the quantity at which ATC is a minimum 
	* You can see this in action at restaurants, as there are empty tables ( a firm should be able to seat more people if it produces at its efficient scale)
2. Markup
	* A firm's markup is the amount by which price exceeds marginal cost
	* In MC, buyers pay a higher price than in perfect competition and also pay more than marginal cost


### Is Monopolistic Competition Efficient?

Resources are used efficiently when MSB = MSC. Price = MSB, and firm's marginal cost = MSC, so if the price of a good is greater than the cost to make it the quantity produced is inefficient. And as discussed through markup and other factors price > MC so is the quantity produced less than the efficient quantity?

#### Making the Relevant Comparison

The markup that drives a gap between price and marginal cost in MC arises from differentation, it is because the good from one firm is not exactly the same as one from another firm that causes the elasticity of a good not to be perfectly elastic

If there was only one type of jacket (the good) the benefit of the good would certainly be less than it is with variety, people value variety! 

But if people value variety why don't we see infinite variety? Its extremely costly! each product must be designed and then customers must be informed about it (marketing), these initial costs of design and marketing called setup costs, mean that some varieties that are too close to others already available are just not worth creating

#### The Bottom Line

Product variety is both valued and costly, the efficient degree of product variety is the one for which the MSB of product variety = MSC. The loss that arises because the quantity produced is less than the efficient quantity if offset by the gain that arises from having a greater degree of product variety. So compared to the alternative -- product uniformity -- MC might be efficient


## Product Development and Marketing

### Product Development 

Since new firms enter the industry if there is profit, an existing firm mus continually seek ways of keeping one step ahead of imitators (other firms who imitate the success of profitable firms.   

To maintain economic profit, a firm must either develop an entirely new product, or develop a significantly improved product that provides it with a temporary competitive edge.

A firm that introduces a new or improved and more differentiated product faces a demand that is less elastic and is able to increase its price and make an economic profit. Eventually competitors will catch up and the firm will need to innovate again. 

#### Profit Maximizing Product Development

Similar to profit maximizing output, the profit is maximized when MC = MR of product development, 

At a low level of product development the MR from a better product exceeds the MC. 
At a high level of product development the MR from a better product is less than the MC.


#### Efficiency and Product Development

The MSB of an improved product is the increase in price that consumers are willing to pay for it
The MSc of an improved product is the amount that the firm must pay to make the improvement. 
Profit is maximized when MR = MC, but in MC the MR < Price so product development is not pushed to its efficient level. 

### Advertising

A firm with a differentiated product needs to ensure that its customers know how its product is different from the competition. a firm also may attempt to create a consumer perception that its product is different even when that difference is small.

#### Advertising Expenditures

Firms in MC incur huge costs to ensure buyers appreviate and value the differences between their own products and their competitors. Thus a large proportion of the price that we pay for a good covers the cost of selling it, and this proportion is increasing. 

Advertising expenditures affect the profits of firms in two ways: they increase costs, and the change demand

#### Selling Costs and Total Costs

Selling costs are fixed costs and they increase the firm's total cost!

Therefore advertising costs per unit decrease as the quantity produced increases. 

#### Selling Costs and Demand

Advertising and other selling efforts change the demand for a firm's product. but how? 

Does the demand increase or decrease? 
The most natural answer is that advertising increases demand. 

But all MC firms advertise, and all seek to persuade customers that they have the best deal. If advertising enables a firm to survive, the number of firms in the market might increase. And to the extent that the #firms does increase, advertising *decreases* the demand of any one firm, it also makes the demand for any one firm's product more elastic. So advertising can end up not only lowering ATC but also lowering the markup and price

#### Using Advertising to Signal Quality

What do firm's like Coke or Pepsi gain from advertising?

One answer is that advertising is a signal to the consumer of a high-quality product, a signal is an action taken by an informed person (or firm) to send a message to uninformed people.

For example, a firm with a bad product wouldn't advertise because people would go and buy it discover it is bad and go back to whatever it is they bought before

On the other hand, a product that is good will advertise because it is confident consumers would try it and keep using it. 

If advertising is a signal, it doesn't need any specific information, it just needs to be expensive and hard to miss, which is what a lot of advertising looks like.

### Brand Names

Many firms create and spend a lot of money promoting a brand name.What benefit does a brand name bring to justify the sometimes high cost of establishing it? 

* A brand name provides info to cunsumers about the quality of a product and is an incentive to the producer to achieve a high and consistent quality standard

An unknown firm may produce a better good, but you may know the quality of the good produced by a brand name and therefore pick it just to be safe. 

### Efficiency of Advertising and Brand Names 

To the extent that advertising and brand names provide consumers with info about the precise nature of product differences and product quality, they benefit the consumer and enable a better product choice to be made. But the oppurtunity cost of the additional info must be weighed against the gain to the consumer.
