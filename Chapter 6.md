## A Housing Market with a Rent Ceiling
Housing is the largest proportion of income spent, when rents are high, or when they jump by a large amount, renters may lobby for limits on rent.
A *price ceiling or price cap* is a government regulation that makes it illegal to charge a price higher than a specified level.
The effects of a price ceiling depend on whether the ceiling is placed above or below the *equilibrium price*
If it is set above, then it has no effect on the rent. This is because the force of the law and market forces are not in conflict. If it is set below equilibrium then there are powerful effects on the market. This is because the force of law and the market forces are in conflict (price ceiling attempts to prevent the price from regulating the quantities demanded and supplied).
When a price ceiling is applied to a housing market it is called a *rent ceiling*. If it is set below the equilibirum it creates:
1. A housing shortage
2. Increased Search Activity
3. A Black Market

### A Housing Shortage

At equilibrium quantity demanded = quantity supplied, at rent set below equilibrium, the housing demand exceeds quantity supplied. Therefore there is a shortage, quantity available is quantity supplied and this must be allocated among demanders. This can be done through increased search activity.

### Increased Search Activity

*Search Activity* is the time spent looking for someone with whom to do business. When price is regulated and there is a shortage, search activity increases as it takes longer to find someone willing to do business. Recall that the oppurtunity cost of a good is not only its price but also the value of the search time spent finding the good, so you're oppurtunity cost increases in a shortage. A rent ceiling only controls the rent portion of the cost of housing it does not account for the increase in search activity which may end up making the full cost of housing *higher* than it was before.

### A Black Market

A rent ceiling also encourages illegal trading in a *black market*, an illegal market in which the equilibrium price exceeds the price ceiling. Examples in the housing market are key deposits and worthless fittings being charged when signing the lease. The level of black market rent depends on how tightly the rent ceiling is enforced, with loose enforcement the black market rent is close to the unregulated rent, but with strict enforcement the black market rent is equal to the maximum price a renter is willing to pay. 

### Inefficiency of a Rent Ceiling
A rent ceiling set below the equilibrium rent results in an inefficient underproduction of housing services, the *marginal social benefit* of housing exceeds is *marginal social cost* and a deadweight loss shrinks the producer and consumer surplus. 

### Are Rent Ceilings Fair?

Rent ceilings may be inefficient, but don't they achieve a fairer allocation of scarce housing?

According to fair rules view, anything that blocks voluntary exchange is unfair, so rent ceilings are unfair. But according to fair result view a fair outcome is one that benefits the less well off. So according to this view the fairest outcome is the one that allocates fair housing to the poorest. To see whether rent ceilings achieve this we need to consider how the market allocates scarce housing resources with a rent ceiling. 
Blocking rent adjustments doesn't eliminate scarcity, rather it creates an even bigger challenge as it decreases the quantity of housing available. Somehow the market must ration a smaller quantity of housing to more people. 
Some possible mechanisms to allocate are: 
* Lottery --> not fair to poor as random
* First come first serve --> allocates to people with greatest foresight not poorest
* Discrimination --> Allows the owner to decide who gets it the housing, not the poorest

It is tough to make and argument for rent ceilings on the basis of fairness

## A Labour Market with a Minimum Wage

The labour market is the market that influences the job we get and the wages we earn. When wage rates are low, or when the fail to keep up with rising prices, labour unions may turn to governments and lobby for a higher wage rate.
A government regulation that makes it illegal to charge a price lower than a specified level is called a *price floor*
If the price floor is below equilibrium price, it has no effect. 
If it is above equilibrium price it has a powerful effect.
When a price floor is applied t labour markets it is called a minimum wage. 

### Minimum Wage Brings Unemployment

If the minimum wage is set above the equilibrium wage, the quantity of labour supplied exceeds the quantity demanded and there is a surplus of labour. 
The quantity of labour hired at the minimum wage is less than the quantity that would be hired in an unregulated labour marker. 
Becuase the legal wage rate cannot eliminate surplus, the minimum wage creates unemployment!

### Is the Minimum Wage Fair?

The minimum wage is unfair on both views of fairness, it delivers an unfair result ( only people who have jobs and keep them benefit from a minimum wage, people without are worse off) and an unfair rule (it blocks voluntary exchange of labour at a lower wage)

### Inefficiency of a Minimum Wage

A minimum wage leads to an inefficient outcome, the quantity of labour employed is less than the efficient quantity. The supply of labour measures the marginal social cost of labour to workers, and the demand for labour measures the marginal social benefit from labour.

## Taxes
Everything you earn and most things bought are taxes. Income tax and EI are deducted from your pay, and sales taxes are added to the things you buy. Your employer pays the employer's contribution to EI. 

### Tax Incidence
The division of the burden of a tax between buyers and sellers is *tax incidence*
When an item is taxes, its price may rise by the full amount of the tax, by a lesser amount, or not at all. 
If it rises by full -> buyer pays the tax
If it rises by lesser -> both pay the tax
If it doesn't rise -> sellers pay the tax

### A tax on Sellers

A tax on sellers is like an increase in cost, so it decreases supply. To determine the position of the new supply curve we add the tax to the minimum price that sellers are willing to accept for each quantity sold. This will shift the equilibirum to less supplied, and increase the equilibrium price

### A tax on Buyers
A tax on buyers lowers the amount they are willing to pay sellers, so it decreases demand and shifts the demand curve leftward. To determine the position of the new demand curve, subtract the tax from the maximum price the buyers are willing to par for each quantity bought. This will shift the equilibrium leftwards by the same amount it would if the tax was on sellers

### Equivalence of Tax on Buyers and Sellers
The tax on buyers and the tax on sellers both shift the equilibrium quantity by the same amount! This is because buyers respond to the price including the tax, and sellers respond to the price excluding the tax. 
A tax is like a wedge between the price buyers pay and the price sellers receive. The size of the wedge determines to effects of the tax, not the side of the market on which the government imposes the tax.

### Taxes and Efficiency
Except in the extreme cases of perfectly inelastic demand or perfectly inelastic supply when the quantity reamins the same, imposing a tax creates an inefficiency.

With no tax, marginal social benefit equals marginal social cost. Total surplus is maximized and the market is efficient. The tax decreases the quantity bought, raises the buyer's price, and lower's the sellers price.
Nor marginal social benefit exceeds marginal social cost and the tax is ineffeicient. The tax revenue takes part of the total surplus and the decreases quantity creates a deadweight loss.

### Tax Incidence of Elasticity of Demand

The division of the tax between buyers and sellers depends on the elasticities of demand and supply.
 
 Perfectly inelastic demand: the buyer pays the entire tax
 Perfectly elastic demand: the seller pays the entire tax

Between these two extremes is a mixture, but the more inelastic the demand, the larger the buyer's share of the tax

### Tax Incidence of Elasticity of Supply

To see the effect of the elasticity of supply on the division of the tax payment look at two extremes:

Perfectly inelastic supply: seller pays entire tax
Perfectly elastic supply: buyer pays entire tax

The more elastic the supply, the larger the buyer's share of the tax

### Taxes and Efficiency

A tax drives a wedge between the buying price and the selling price and results in inefficent underproduction. The price buyers pay is also the buyers' willingness to pay, which measures marginal social benefit. The price sellers receive is also the sellers' minimum supply-price which equals marginal social cost

A tax makes the MSB exceed MSC, shrinks the producer and consumer surplus, and creates deadweight loss.

With a tax, the sellers minimum supply price rises by the amount of the tax and the supply curve shifts to S + tax
The tax component isnt a social cost of production, it is a transfer of resources to the government. At the new equilibrium quantity both consumer and producer surplus shrink and parts of both go to the government. Only in the extreme cases (perfectly inelastic demand, perfectly inelastic supply)  a tax does not change the quantity bought and sold so that no deadweight loss arises.

### Taxes and Fairness
Econommists propose two conflicting principles of fairness to apply to a tax system: 

* The benefits principle
* The ability-to-pay principle

#### The Benefits Principle

The benefits principle is the proposition people should pay taxes equal to the benefits they receive from the services provided by the government. 
This is fair as it means those who benefit most pay the most taxes

#### The Ability-to-Pay Principle
The ability-to-pay principle is the proposition that people should pay taxes according to how easily they can bear the burden of the tax.

A rich person can more easily bear the burden than a poor person can

## Production Quotas and Subsidies

Intervention in markets for farm products takes two main forms
* Production Quota --> upper limit to the quantity of a good that may be produced during a period
* Subsidies --> payments made by the government to a producer
### Production Quota
These have no effect when set above the equilibrium, but profound effects when set below the equilibrium:
* decrease in supply
* rise in price
* decrease in marginal cost
* ineffeicient underproduction
* an incentive to cheat and overproduce
All of these are similar to price ceilings studied earlier.

### Subsidies
The effects of subsidies are similar to the of a tax, but in the opposite direction:
* An increase in supply
* A fall in price and increase in quantity produced
* increase in marginal cost
* payments by governments to people (as opposed to taxes)
* Inefficient overproduction

## Markets for Illegal Goods

The Canadian government prohibits trade of some goods, such as illegal drugs. Yet, markets exist for illegal goods and services. How does the market work? To see how this works first look at a free market and see the changes that occur when the good is made illegal

If the good were not illegal the supply and demand curve would be similar to any other good, however, it is illegal so a penalty is passed on to sellers and buyers.

### Penalties on Sellers

If the penalty on the seller is the amount CBL, the supply of the drug will decrease to S+CBL (shift up of the supply curve as more risk is taken to supply the good)
The price rises and the quantity decreases

### Penalties on Buyers

If the penalty on the buyer is the amount CBL, then the demand for the good will decrease to D - CBL. The market price will fall and the quantity decreases. 

But the oppurtunity cost of buying this good increases, and the buyer pays the market price *plus* the cost of breaking the law.

### Penalties on Both Sellers and Buyers
With both sellers and buyers penalized for trading in the illegal drug, both the demand and supply curve decrease

### Legalizing and Taxing Drugs
An illegal good can be legalized and taxed
A high enough tax rate would decrease consumption to the level that occurs when trade is illegal
Arguments that extend beyond economics surround this choice.
