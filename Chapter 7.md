# Chapter 7 Global Markets In Action

## How Global Markets Work

Because we trade with people from other countris, the goods and services that we as Canadians can buy and consume are not limited by what other Canadians produce. 
* Imports are goods or services bought from other countries
* Exports are goods or services sold to other countries

### What Drives International Trade

*Comparative Advantage*  is the driving force behind international trade. Comparative advantage is the situation in which a person (or country) can perform an activity or produce a good or service at a lower oppurtunity cost than anyone else. We define *National Comparative Advantage* as a situation in which a nation can produce a good or service at a lower oppurtunity cost than any other nation.

For example, China has a comparative advantage in t-shirt production, while Canada has one in regional jet manufacturing. Since each country has a comparative advantage, the people of both countries can specialize to their service and trade and both be better off. Also through trade, both countries can sell their good for a higher price than they would locally, thus both gain from international trade. 

 When determining countries net gain from exporting we need to know the world market price for a good, and the countries supply/demand curve, this will tell us how many of the good can be produced and exported. e.g. if equilibrium quantity is 20 units at $10, world market is $15 for a unit, the suppliers will sell the new amount of units that Canadians will buy at $15, then the excess that they will export.

## Winners Losers and the Net Gain From Trade

We will see why producers complain about cheap foreign imports, while consumers never complain.

### Gains and Losses from Imports

We examine the gains and losses from imports by examining their effect on the consumer surplus, producer surplus, and total surplus. 

### Gains and losses from Imports

Without imports:
Consumer surplus, producer surplus decided by domestic supply + demand

With imports:
Consumer surplus expands (as they can now buy from the world market)
Increase in total surplus
Producer surplus shrinks
Market price changes to be the world price ( less then non import market price) 
Demand increases

### Gains and Losses from Exports

Without exports: 
Consumer surplus, producer surplus decided by domestic supply + demand

With exports:
Consumer Surplus shrinks
Increase in total surplus
Producer surplus increases (as they can now sell tot he world market)
Market price changes to become world price (higher than non export market price)
Supply increases

### Gains For All
When exporting the producer benefits, and the consumer from the other country benefits, it is a win win for both countries

## International Trade Restrictions:

Governments use four sets of tools to influence national trade and protect domestic industries from foreign competition:
1. Tariffs
2. Im port quotas
3. Other import barriers
4. Export Subsidies

### Tariffs

A *tariff* is a tax on a good that is imposed by the importing country when an imported good crosses its international border. 

Tariffs raise revenue for governments and serve the self-interest of people who earn their incomes in import-competing industries. 
Restrictions on free international trade decrease the gains from trade and are not in the social interest.

#### The Effects of a Tariff

Without a tariff:
Market price = World price
Higher demand for good then when not imported

With a tariff:
Market price = World price + tariff
Tariff Revenue exists
Quantity demanded decreases as price is increased
Quantity of good produced within Canada increases
Quantity imported decreases

* Rise in the price of a good: 
	* The price rises the full amount of the tariff, and the consumer 			   pays the entirety of the tariff because the suplly from the rest of 				the world is perfectly elastic

* Decrease in Purchases:
	* The higher price of a good brings a decrease in the quantity demanded along the demand curve.

* Increase in Domestic Production:
	* The higher price of a good stimulates domestic production, and Canadian suppliers increase the qunatity supplied along the supply curve,

* Decrease in Imports:
	* Imports decrease as there is an increase in domestic production **and** a decrease in domestic demand

#### Winners Losers and the Social Loss from a Tariff

When the Canadian Government imposes a tariff on a good the following is the outcome:

* Canadian consumers of the good lose
* Canadian producers of the good gain
* Consumers lose more than producers gain
* Society loses; a deadweight loss arises

* Canadian consumers of the good lose:
	* The price of the good rises, the quantity demanded decreases, this decreases the consumer surplus -- which is the loss to consumers from the tariff
* Canadian producers of the good gain:
	* The combination of a higher price and larger quantity produced increases the producer surplus, which is the gain to producers from the tariff
* Consumers lose more than producers gain:
	* Consumer surplus decreases for four reasons 
		1. some is lost due to higher cost of production
		2.  some becomes producer surplus
		3. some is lost because improts decrease
		4. some goes to the government as tariff revenue (remember consumers pay **All** of the tariff
* Society loses; a deadweight loss arises:
	* Some of the loss of the consumer surplus is transferred to producers and some to the government, and spent on programs people value, **but** the increase in production cost and loss from decreases imports is transferred to noone, creating deadweight loss.

### Import Quotas

An *import quota* is a restriction that limits the quantity of a good that may be imported in a given period.

#### The Effect of an Import Quota

The effects are similar to a tariff, price rises, quantity bought decreases, and quantity produced in Canada increases.

#### Winners Losers and the Social Loss From an Import Quota

The winners and losers are similar to a tariff, but with an interesting difference

When the government imposes an import quota:
* Canadian consumers of the good lose
*  Canadian producers of the good gain
*  Importers of the good gain
* Society loses; a deadweight loss arises.

Consumer surplus shrinks, this decrease is the loss to consumers form the quota. It is made up of four parts:

1. Some is transferred to producers
2. Part is lost because the increase in domesticc product is produced at a higher cost of production then the world price
3. Part is transferred to the importers who import at the market rate but sell at the new quota rate **this is analogous to the profit made by the government with a tariff**
4.  Part is lost due to a decrase in imports

### Other Import Barriers 

Two sets of policies influencing imports are:
1. Health, Safety and Regulation Barriers
2. Voluntary Export Restraints
	* Like a quota allocated to a foreign exporter of a good, i.e. limitting exports of car parts to the USA

### Export Subsidies

An *export subsidy* is a payment by the government to the producer of an exported good. These are illegal under a number of international free trade agreements, and the rules of the WTO. Export subsidies bing gains to domestic producers, but they result in inefficient underproduction in the rest of the world and create deadweight loss.

## The Case Against Protection

As we just studied, trade promotes prosperity and protection is inefficient, yet it is restricted with all of th things we looked at. Why? there are seven arguments that we will investigate:

1. Helps an Infant Industry Grow
	* Comparative advantage changes with on the job experience, i.e. someone may get better at producing a good after a while ( nobody starts anything at their highest skill)
	* It is argued that some industries should be protected until they blossom
	* Although this is true, it doesn't justify it, firms anticipate and benefit from learning by doing.
2. Counteracts Dumping
	* *Dumping* occurs when a foreign firm sells its exports at a lower price than the cost of production.
	* Dumping could be used by a firm to gain a global monopoly
	* This can push local firms out of business by undercutting the market
	* Dumping is illegal under the WTO, and is regarded as justification for temporary tariffs, called *countervailing duties*
	* It is extremely difficult to accurately judge whether dumping is occuring, as the demand for an item within a region can decide the price to sell it as well as being very difficult to tell what a firms cost is.
3. Saves Domestic Jobs
	* Free trade does destroy jobs, but it also creates others, it brings about a global rationalization of labour and allocates labour resources to their highest valued activities. 
	* Although protection can save particular jobs, it does so at a high cost
	* Imports don't only destroy jobs, they create jobs for retailers that sell imported goods and for firms that service those goods. 
	* They also create jobs by creating income in the rest of the world
4. Allows Us to Compete with Cheap Foreign Labour
	* With the removal of tariffs on trade beteen Canada, US, and Mexico people said all of the jobs would go to Mexico, that obviously didn't happen. Why?
	* It didn't happen because low-wage labour is low-productivity labour.
	* Other things remaining the same, the higher a workers productivity, the higher their wage
	* It is *comparative advantage* not wage differences that drive international trade
	
5. Penalizes Lax Environmental Standards
	* Another argument is that protection provides an incentive for poor countries to raise their environmental standards -- free trade with the richer and "greener" countries as a reward for improved standards
	* This is weak
		* First a poor country cannot afford to be as concerned with its environmental standards as a rich country can
		*  Second, a  poor country may have comparative advantage doing "dirty" work, which helps it to raise its income and at 							        										the same time enables the global economy to achieve higher standards then otherwise possible
	*  As income grows (through free trade...) emerging counrtires have the means to match their desires to improve their environment. 
6. Prevents Rich Countries from Exploiting Developing Countries
	* Prevent the rich countries form exploiting the poorer people of developing countries and forcing them to work for slave wages
	*  Child labour and near-slave labour are bad, but by trading with poor countries we increase demand for the goods those countries produce and increase demand for their labour. 
	* Demand increase -> wage rates increase : trade can improve their oppurtunities and increase their income
7. Reduces Offshore Outsourcing that Sends Jobs to Other Countries
	*  *Offshore Outsourcing* -- buying goods, components, or services from firms in other countries brings gains from trade identical to those of any other type of trade
	* i.e. outsourcing call-centres to India instead of Canada takes jobs away from Canadians
	* Despite the gain from specialization and trade that offshore outsourcing brings, many people believe that it also brings cost that eat up the gains, why?
		* A major reason is it seems to send good Canadian jobs to to other countries
		* While true, other industries expand in Canada, Canada imports call-centres, but exports education, health-care.. legal, financial, and a host of other services (which others outsource to **us**)
		*  The exact number of jobs that have moved to lower-cost offshore location is not known, and estimates vary, but even the highest estimate is small compared to the normal rate of job creation and labour turnover
	* Gains from trade do not bring gains for everyone, Canadians on average, gain from outsourcing, but some people lose (those who invest heavily in industries being outsourced)


### Avoiding Trade Wars
We have reviewed the arguments commonly heard in favour of protection, and the counterarguments against it. But one counterargument to protection that is general and quite overwhelming is that protection invites retaliation and trigger a trade war

A *trade war* is a contest in which when one country raises its import tariffs, other countries retaliate with increases of their ow, which triggers further retaliation from the first country... 

In trade wars, the cost to all countries are large

### Why is International Trade Restricted

Why, despite all the arguments against protection is trade restricted?
* Tariff Revenue
	* Government revenue is costly to collect, in developed countries, a well organized tax collection system is in place that can generate billions in income tax and sales tax
	* Governments in developing countries have much more difficult times collecting taxes from their citizens, as much economic activity takes place in an informal economy with few records. The one area where transactions are well recorded is international trade, so these governments can easily tax these through tariffs
	
* Rent Seeking
	* Rent seeking is the mahor reason why international trade is restricted.
	* *Rent Seeking* is lobbying for special treatment by the government to create economic profit or to divert consumer/producer surplus away from others
	* Free trade increases consumption possibilities *on average*, but not everyone shares in the gain, and some lose. 
	* The number of winners from free trade is large, but because the gains are spread thinly over a large number of people, the gain per person is small.  
		* These people could come together and lobby for free trade, but political activity is costly. It takes time and other scarce resources and the gains per person are too small to make the cost of political activity worth bearing
	* Conversely the losers are spread over a small number of people but the losses are huge, it is much more likely for them to form a political action group and lobby against free trade
	* The protectionists (the losers) undertake a largerquantity of political obbying than the free traders (the winners)

### Compensating Losers

If, in total the gains from free trade exceed the losses, why don't those who gain compensate the losers?
* they do... in NAFTa a $56 million  dollar fund was set up to support and retrain workers who lost their jobs
* The losers are also compensated indirectly through the normal unemployment compensation arrangements
* The main reason full compensation is not attempted is the cost of identifying all the losers and estimating the value of their losses is enormous. It is also difficult to tell what caused them to become a loser (was it free trade or something else), furthermore, some people may at some point look like losers, but they end up being winners.

Because we do not in general compensate the lsoers form free international trade, protectionism is a popular and permanent feature of our national economic and political life.
