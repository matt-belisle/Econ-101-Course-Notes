## What is Perfect Competition

*Perfect Competition* is a market in which: 
* Many firms sell identical products to many buyers
* There are **no** restrictions on entry into the market
* Established firms have no advantage over new ones
* Sellers **and** buyers are well informed about prices

### How Perfect Competition Arises

Perfect competition arisies if the minimum efficient scale of a single producer is small relative to the market demand for the good or service, in this situation, there is room in the market for many firms. A firms *minimum efficient scale* is the smallest output at which long-run average cost reaches its lowest level. 

In perfect competition, each firm produces a good that has no unique characteristics, so consumers don't care which they buy (e.g. plactic grocery bags)

### Price Takers

Firms in perfect competition are *price takers*, a price taker is a firm that cannot influence the market price as its production is an insignificant part of the total market A price taker takes whatever price is available on the market

### Economic Profit and Revenue

A firm's goal is to maximize its *economic profit* which is equal to total revenue minus total cost. Total cost is the oppurtunity cost of production which *includes* normal profit. 

A firm's total revenue equals the price of its output multiplied by the number of units sold (P*Q) 

*Marginal Revenue* is the change in total revenue that results from a one-unit increase in quantity sold. MR is calculated by dividing the change in total revenue by the change in quantity sold

* In perfect competition the firm is a price taker, so the marginal revenue is *equal* to the market price

#### Demand for a Firm's Product

The firm can sell any quantity it chooses at the market price, so the demand curve is a horizontal line at the market price, this is the same line as the marginal revenue. Since the demand curve is a horizontal line, the demand is perfectly elastic, a product from firm A is a *perfect substitute* for the same product from any other firm. 
However, the *market* demand for sweaters is not perfectly elastic, its elasticity depends on the substitutablility for the good for other goods or service.

### The Firm's Decisions

The goal of a competitive firm is to maximize economic profit, given the constraints it faces, therefore it must decide on the following three things:
1. How to produce at minimum cost
	* It does this by operating with the plant that minimizes long run average cost
2. What quantity to produce
3. Whether to enter or exit a market

We will study the second decision next.

## The Firm's Output Decision

A firm's cost curves (TC, ATC, and MC) describe the relationship between outputs and costs

A firm's revenue curves (TR, MR) describe the relationship bewteen output and revenue

From these curves we can determine the output that maximizes the firm's economic profit

The *Break Even point* is the point(s) in which TC = TR 
 
 ### Marginal Analysis and the Supply Decision
 
Another way to find the profit-maximizing output is to use marginal analysis, which compares marginal revenue (MR) with marginal cost (MC). As output increases, the firm's MR is constant but its MC eventually increases. If MR > MC, then the revenue from selling one more unit exceeds the cost of producing it, and increasing production will increase economic profit. If MR < MC, then the cost of producing one more unit exceeds the cost of producing it and increasing production will decrease economic profit. IF MR = MC, then the revenue from selling one more unit equals the cost of producing that unit, and economic profit is maximized! 

### Temporary Shutdown Decision

If MR=MC this will maximize profit, nut suppose at this quantity price is less than average total cost, in this case there is an economic loss. Maximum profit is still a loss (minimum loss), what does the firm do?

If the firm expects this loss to be permanent it goes out of business. If it expects this to be temporary the firm must decide whether to shut down temporarily and produce no output, or to keep producing, to make this decision the firm must compare the loss form shutting down with the loss from producing and take the action the *minimizes* its loss.

####Loss Comparisons

Recall:
*Economic Loss = TFC + (AFC-P)\*Q* 
If the firm shuts down the quantity produces will be 0 and the loss will be equal to TFC

If the firm produces then in addition to its fixed costs, it incurs variable costs. **But** it also receives revenue.
Its economic loss equals TFC ( the loss when shut down ) + TVC - TR, if TVC exceeds TR then the firm shuts down. Equivalently, if AVC exceeds price, this loss exceeds total fixed cost and the firm shuts down

#### The Shutdown Point

A firm's shutdown point is the price and quantity at which it is indifferent between producing and shutting down. The shutdown point occurs at the price and the quantity at which AVC is at a minimum. At the shutdown point the firm is minimizing its loss and its loss equals TFC. If the price falls below minimum AVC, the firm shuts down temporarily and continues to incur a loss equal to TFC. At prices above the minimum AVC but below ATC the firm produces the loss-minimzing output and incurs a loss, **but** that loss is less than total fixed cost.

### The Firm's Supply Curve

A perfectly competitive firm's supply curve shows hot its profit maximizing output varies as the market price varies, other things remaining the same. It is derived from the MC curve, and the AVC cost curves. 

When the price exceeds Minimum AVC, the firm maximizes profit by producing the output at which MC = Price.

When the price is less than Minimum AVC< the firm shuts down and produces no output.

When the price equals Minimum AVC, the firm maximizes profit by either temporarily shutting down, or by producing the output at which AVC is a minimum (the shut down point)

## Output, Price, and Profit in the Short Run

To determine the price and quantity in a perfectly competitive market, we need to know how market demand and market supply interact. We start by studying it in the short run. In the short run the number of firms is *fixed*.

### Market Supply in the Short Run

The *short-run-market-supply* curve shows the quantity supplied by all the firms in the market at each price when each firm's plant and the number of firm's remain the same. 

We've seen how an individual firm's market supply curve is derived from their supply curves, the quantity supplied by the market at a given price is the sum of the quantities supplied by all the firms in the makret at that price. 

At the break-even point, some firm's will shut down and some will stay open, this depends entirely on their individual costs (mostly how large their AFC and AVC are). 

At prices below the break even point, the market supply curve runs across the y-axis

At the break-even point the supply is perfectly elastic

### Short Run Equilibrium

Market demand and short-reun market supply determine the market price and the market output, the output per firm should be equivalent.

### A Change in Demand

If the demand increases (shifts right) , each firm will increase production
If the demand decreases (shifts left) , each firm will decrease production to a point
If the demand is so low that the price is now at/below the break even point the amount of goods produced doesn't change as the market supply curve is horizontal.  The number of firm's producing at that demand is just enough to satisfy market demand.

### Profit and Losses in the Short Run

In short-run equilibrium the firm produces the profit-maximizing output, it does not necessarily end up making economic profit. It may make profit, but it alternatively may break even or occur economic loss. 

## Output, Price, and Profit in the Long Run

In short-run equlibrium a firm may make a profit, incur economic loss, or break even. Only one of these is a long-run equilibrium (making a profit) , this is because firms may enter or exit the market. 

### Entry and Exit
* *Entry* is when a firm enters the market -> #firms increases
*  *Exit* is when a firm leaves the market -> #firms decreases

Firms respond to economic profit and economic loss by either entering or exiting a market. New firms enter a market in which other firms are making an economic profit, and firms exit a market in which they are incurring an economic loss. 

Temporary economic loss and economic profit don't trigger entry and exit, only the prospect of persistent economic loss and economic profit triggers entry and exit.

Entry and exit change the market supply, which influences market price, the quantity produced by each firm, and its economic profit/loss

If firms enter a market, market supply increases and the market supply curve shifts right, the increase in supply lowers market price, and eventually eliminates economic profit, when this happens no other firm enters the market. The quantity supplied by each firm in the market decreases

If firms leave a market, market supply decreases and the market supply curve shifts left, the decrease in supply raises market price and economic loss decreases, eventually loss is eliminated and exit stops. The quantity supplied by each firm in the market increases

### Long Run Equilibrium

When economic profit and economic loss have been eliminated and entry and exit have been stopped, a competitive market is in *long-run equilibrium* 

## Changes in Demand and Supply as Technology Advances

What happens to a competitive market when the demand for its product changes? The perfect competition model can answer this question

### An Increase in Demand

When demand increases economic profit increases for the firms in the market (price goes up) , in the long run new firms will enter the market until the market returns to zero economic profit (price returns back to where it was). During the transition period all firms make a profit

### A Decrease in Demand

Opposite of an increase in demand, firms leave the market until economic loss has been eliminated and price returns to where it was. During the transition period no firms make a profit

### Technological Advances Change Supply

In the long run:
* Firms introduce the new technology and lowers their production cost, the firms make more profit
* As more firms use the new technology market supply increases and profit falls
* At first, more firms enter and use the new technology as the firms using the new technology are making profit
* The firms who are still using the old technology end up making an economic loss as it costs their MC and ATC curves are higher than the firms using the new technology
* The firms using the old technology exit the market
* The market balances back to zero economic profit and the price falls to a new equilibrium price

Technological change brings only temporary gains to producers. But the lower prices and better products that technological advances bring are permanent gains for consumers.

## Competition and Efficiency

### Efficient Use of Resources

Resource use is efficient when we produce the goods and services that people value most highly. If it is possible to make someone better off without anyone else becoming worse off, resources are not being used efficiently. 

We can test whether resources are allocated efficiently by comparing marginal social benefit and marginal social cost. 

### Choices, Equilibrium, and Efficiency
#### Choices

Consumers allocate their budgets to get the most value possible out of them. We derive a consumers demand curve by finding how the best budget allocation changes as the price of a good changes. So consumers get the most value out of their resources at all points along their demand curves. If the people who consume a good or service are the only ones who benefit from it, then the market demand curve measures the benefit to the entire society and is the marginal social benefit curve.

Competitive firms produce the quantity that maximizes profit. We derive the firm’s supply curve by finding the profit-maximizing quantity at each price. So firms get the most value out of their resources at all points along their supply curves. If the firms that produce a good or service bear all the costs of producing it, then the market supply curve measures the marginal cost to the entire society and the market supply curve is the marginal social cost curve.


#### Equilibrium and Efficiency

Resources are used efficiently when marginal social benefit equals marginal social cost. Competitive equilibrium achieves this efficient outcome because, with no externalities, price queals marginal social benefit for consumers, and price equals marginal social cost for producers.
